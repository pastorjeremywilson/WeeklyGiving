            At the top of the screen you will see a toolbar. On the left of the bar are buttons you can use to navigate the records you create:
            <ul>
                <li>Go to the first record</li>
                <li>Go to the previous record</li>
                <li>Go to the next record</li>
                <li>Go to the last record</li>
                <li>Create a new record</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the center of the toolbar, you can bring up your records by ID number or by date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, on the right-hand side, there are buttons to print the current record, create a graph of giving between certain dates, and save the current record. This save button is only active after changes have been made to the current record.

            In the file menu, you will find commands to save the current record, print the current record, and exit the program.

        <p>
            In the tools menu, you will find commands to create a new record, delete the current record, or view the log file, which may contain information about program crashes or undesired behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the settings menu, you will find commands to change the name that appears in the program and on your printed report, change the names of the special offering designations, change the number of checks that appears in the Checks section of your records, and to save the file that stores all your records to a different location. Note that there is currently no way to change the number of special offering designations, that number being fixed at seven.
